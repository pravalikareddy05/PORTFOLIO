        <h2>About my college lifeðŸ“š</h2>
        <p>
            My college name is TKR college of engineering and technology.The chairman of  my college is Teegala Krishna Reddy.Actually i like my college because there is greenary everywhere which gives you peace and positive vibes when you entered into college.Our college has a several blocks which include Main block,south block,North block,T block and we also have a big playground.Our facualty helps us in every aspect like studies,sports and extra circular.
            I have a very few very close friends but we spend a lot of time together in college,we go to trips and each other's home.we always had a lot of fun but in a few days our college life will be over,we gonna seperate from each other and moveon with our life.I'll miss them a lot,more than they think.In these four years we became so close as i never imagined,i really don't want to loose them because i cannot replace anyone to their place in my heart.
